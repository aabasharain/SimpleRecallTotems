Two ways this addon can be used to recall totems:

1) The UI button text "Recall All Totems", this can be clicked to recall totems.
It can be dragged and moved around by right clicking the text.

2) Create a macro with the following text:

/click SRT_totem1
/click SRT_totem2
/click SRT_totem3
/click SRT_totem4

Using this macro will also recall all totems and can be assigned to any key like a normal macro.

This text can be found in game and copied from the config window (brough up using the command "/srt config").

"/srt config" is the only command and brings a settings window up to:

- enable/disable the button
- reset the buttons position to the middle of the screen (right click to move again)
- a copy-able text box to copy for creating the macro (use CTRL+A and CTRL+C to copy text)
